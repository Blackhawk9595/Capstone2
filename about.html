  <p>
  The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about<br>
  or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be<br>
  significant for agricultural, civil, religious or social reasons. For example, a<br>
   calendar provides a way to determine when to start planting or harvesting, which<br>
   days are religious or civil holidays, which days mark the beginning and end of<br>
   business accounting periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the<br>
    day taxes are due or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying<br>
    a day, provide other useful information about the day such as its season.<br>

  Calendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules,<br>
  time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work,<br>
  school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems<br>
  and may keep both a business and family calendar to help prevent them<br>

  from overcommitting their time.<br>
  Calendars are also used as part of a complete timekeeping system:<br>
  date and time of day together specify a moment in time. In the modern<br>
  world, timekeepers can show time, date and weekday. Some may also show<br>
  lunar phase.<br>
