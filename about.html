<h1>Hi </h1>



  <p>The primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days: to be informed about</p>
  <p>or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened. Days may be</p>
   <p>significant for agricultural, civil, religious or social reasons. For example, a</p>
   <p>calendar provides a way to determine when to start planting or harvesting, which</p>
   <p>days are religious or civil holidays, which days mark the beginning and end of</p>
   <p>business accounting periods, and which days have legal significance, such as the</p>
   <p>day taxes are due or a contract expires. Also a calendar may, by identifying</p>
    <p>a day, provide other useful information about the day such as its season.</p>

  <p>Calendars are also used to help people manage their personal schedules,</p>
  <p>time and activities, particularly when individuals have numerous work,</p>
  <p>school, and family commitments. People frequently use multiple systems</p>
  <p>and may keep both a business and family calendar to help prevent them</p>

  <p>from overcommitting their time.</p>
  <p>Calendars are also used as part of a complete timekeeping system:</p>
  <p>date and time of day together specify a moment in time. In the modern</p>
  <p>world, timekeepers can show time, date and weekday. Some may also show</p>
  <p>lunar phase.</p>
